# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

This project focuses on predicting **wine quality** using **machine learning** techniques. The dataset consists of various physicochemical properties such as **acidity, sugar content, and alcohol percentage**, which influence wine quality. The goal is to train and evaluate models that can classify wine samples based on these features.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with data visualization
- 🛠 **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Model Training & Evaluation**
- 📊 **Performance Comparison** of different classification models

## 📂 Files
- **`wine_data.csv`** - Dataset containing wine samples and their quality ratings.
- **`Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb`** - Jupyter Notebook with complete analysis, visualization, and machine learning implementation.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python**
- 📦 **Pandas, NumPy** for data processing
- 📊 **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for data visualization
- 🤖 **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models

## 🏁 How to Run
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/AhmedMemon-007/wine-quality-prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd Wine-Quality-Prediction
3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb


## 📌 Future Improvements
- Implement **Deep Learning** models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs)
